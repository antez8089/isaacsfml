# The Binding of Isaac: Game Clone

## Tools and Libraries Used

The project is being developed in C++ with a focus on object-oriented programming. The persistence layer will likely rely on saving data to files in CSV and JSON formats. Interaction with the user and the graphical user interface (GUI) will be implemented using the SFML library, while other parts of the program will utilize components from the C++ Standard Library.

The game will feature multiple enemy types, each with distinct behaviors and attack patterns, to provide variety and challenge during gameplay. Players will also have the ability to save their progress, including collected items, room layouts, and character statistics, to external files, allowing for easy continuation of their game.

Procedurally generated levels will ensure that each playthrough feels unique, with randomized room configurations, enemy placement. The SFML library will handle rendering, inputs to create an immersive and engaging experience.
